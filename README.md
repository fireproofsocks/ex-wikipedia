# ExWikipedia

`ExWikipedia` is a Elixir wrapper to the original Wikipedia [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php).
It bundles the Wikipedia API's response into a struct. 

Currently the package only supports searching up Wikipedia Ids.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_wikipedia, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
